•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
The advantages of using python coding on top of the mongo database was the ability to interpret the data easily and quickly into graphs, charts and tables which could be easily edited and updated. The code created to access the mongo database and CRUD can be built upon more or applied to different or bigger data sets. 


•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When working with the Grazioso database/dashboard requirements I focus on one aspect at a time and build upon it. Once it was working the way I intended I went on to the next requirement. For me it was important to try and focus in on one part of the assignment and build off of it so that I didn’t get overloaded with information and goals to achieve.


•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists have the ability to interpret data at a lot higher level and provide useful information or graphs. This type of project would help a company like Grazioso by allowing a customer to look for a certain type of animal and finding out a range of information regarding the type of animal they want like its color, age, and location. This is just one small example of how this information could be beneficial to them. In a real-world scenario, the computer scientist would get with the customer and find out what they are wanting and how they can change the code to achieve their goal.
